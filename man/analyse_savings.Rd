# Example usage:
# Create temporary file paths
fixed_expenses_path <- tempfile(fileext = ".csv")
financial_data_path <- tempfile(fileext = ".csv")
purchases_path <- tempfile(fileext = ".csv")

# Write sample data to files
write.csv(data.frame(title = c("Rent", "Utilities"), amount = c(1000, 200)), 
          fixed_expenses_path, row.names = FALSE)
write.csv(data.frame(month = c("2025-01"), income = c(3000), budget = c(1000)), 
          financial_data_path, row.names = FALSE)
write.csv(data.frame(date = c("2025-01-01", "2025-01-02"),
